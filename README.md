# Java Programs with Exception Handling

This repository contains Java programs demonstrating the use of exception handling in various scenarios.

## RationalNumber.java

This program defines a class `RationalNumber` that represents rational numbers and provides methods to perform arithmetic operations on them. The user can input two rational numbers and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.


## ExceptionDemo.java

This program demonstrates the use of custom exceptions in Java. It defines a custom exception `FactorialException` and calculates the factorial of a user-defined number. If the input number is out of range or not a valid integer, a `FactorialException` is thrown.


## NOMATCHEXCP.java and Demo.java

These programs demonstrate the use of user-defined exceptions in Java. `NOMATCHEXCP` is a custom exception class thrown when the input string does not match the expected value ("India"). `Demo` class prompts the user to enter a string and throws `NOMATCHEXCP` if the input string is not "India".
